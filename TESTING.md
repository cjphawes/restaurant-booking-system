# TESTING

The program was tested constantly throughout the development process. I had multiple users try out my game on multiple web browsers to spot bugs or grammatical mistakes which they found and I corrected, or noted down in the [Compatibility issues](#compatibility-section) section.

## Validation Testing

### Python Files
I used the Code Institute Python Linter to ensure sure the source code throughout was PEP8 compliant. The only errors were found in: 

-   Settings.py
-   

#### Home App
-   urls.py
![]()
